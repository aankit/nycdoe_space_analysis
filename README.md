# NYCDOE Space Analysis

The square foot per person of DOE schools in September 2020 was a point of discussion as folks grappled with remote school. No clear public analyses had been done and I was curious about this metric, especially in different parts of the city. If there was more space in schools in some areas and not others and children were sent back to school, data on disparate impacts would have been useful. Plus it was interesting to dig into datasets from the NYC School Construction Authority.
